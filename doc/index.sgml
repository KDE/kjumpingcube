<sect>Introduction
<p>
KJumpingCube is a simple tactical game. You can play it against the computer 
or against a friend. 
The playingfield consists of squares that contains points. By clicking on
the squares you can increase the points and if the points reach a maximum
the points will jump to the squares neighbours and take them over.

Winner is the one, who owns all squares.

neighbours and take them over. 

<item>Neighbour-Fields are only direct neighbours, not the diagonal neighbours.

<item>Winner is the one, who owns all squares.
