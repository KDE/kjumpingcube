TODO LIST - as at 12 August 2008
--------------------------------

- Bug 168632 (wishlist) - When playing with two computer players, make it
  possible to use different strengths.
- Bug 168641 (wishlist) - Button 'stop' is misleading. Rename it? Abolish it?
  Implement a timeout?
- Bug 168645 (wishlist) - Offer 'replay move slowly' option (to make cascades
  easier to understand).
- Multi-level undo/redo.
- Themeing and hot new stuff.
- Graphics and animations to make saturation and redistribution of a cube's
  points a bit easier to understand, thus making the whole game easier to learn.
- Better strategies in the AI - maybe an "Expert" level of skill.
